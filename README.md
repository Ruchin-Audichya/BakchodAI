# 🧠 BakchodAI – The Meme Startup Generator

Ever procrastinated so hard you accidentally built something viral? Welcome to **BakchodAI**, the most unhinged Gen-Z startup idea generator.

Built in 5 hours (during a DBMS exam crisis) and refined with extra sarcasm, BakchodAI creates memeable startup ideas that are sarcastic, unfiltered, and occasionally brilliant.

## 🚀 What is BakchodAI?

A terminal-style app that generates:

- 🤯 Absurd startup names
- 💬 Sarcastic taglines
- 🧄 Founder quotes that belong on Twitter
- 🔥 Meme roasts that would slap on Insta
- 📣 Auto-generated LinkedIn launch posts

It’s like Shark Tank met Reddit. And failed gloriously.
